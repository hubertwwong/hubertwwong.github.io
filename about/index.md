Just testing out jekyll and github pages for this website. The main page in
twitter bootstrap and I added a plugin to do the categories and added a
css page for some basic modifications like the fonts. Was thinking
of using this space to organize what I worked on so far so its a bit more
cohesive. Page is currently a work in progress. Click on the links above
